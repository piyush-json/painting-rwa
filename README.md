### **Quick Start**

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rwa
   ```

2. **Dependencies Installation**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   anchor build
   ```

4. **Test Suite Execution**
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

## üìã **Smart Contract API**

### **1. Asset Fractionalization**

Transforms a single NFT into multiple tradeable fractional tokens:

```rust
pub fn fractionalize(
    ctx: Context<Fractionalize>,
    total_fractions: u64,
    price_per_fraction: u64,
    royalty_fee_numerator: u16,
    royalty_fee_denominator: u16,
) -> Result<()>
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

- `total_fractions`: Total number of shares to mint (e.g., 10,000)
- `price_per_fraction`: Individual share price in lamports
- `royalty_fee_numerator`: Creator royalty percentage numerator
- `royalty_fee_denominator`: Creator royalty percentage denominator

### **2. Fractional Share Purchase**

Enables KYC-verified investors to acquire fractional ownership:

```rust
pub fn buy_fractions(ctx: Context<BuyFractions>, num_fractions: u64) -> Result<()>
```

**Purchase Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ KYC verification completed
- ‚úÖ Sufficient payment balance (USDC/SPL tokens)
- ‚úÖ Active sale period
- ‚úÖ Available shares remaining

### **3. Complete NFT Redemption**

Allows consolidation of all fractional shares to reclaim original NFT:

```rust
pub fn redeem(ctx: Context<Redeem>) -> Result<()>
```

**Redemption Process:**

- Must possess 100% of fractional tokens
- Automatic token burning upon redemption
- Original NFT transferred to redeemer's wallet

### **4. KYC Compliance System**

#### User Registration

```rust
pub fn register_kyc(ctx: Context<RegisterKyc>) -> Result<()>
```

#### Admin Verification

```rust
pub fn verify_kyc(ctx: Context<VerifyKyc>, is_verified: bool) -> Result<()>
```

## üèõÔ∏è **Data Structures**

### **Vault Management Account**

```rust
pub struct Vault {
    pub creator: Pubkey,              // Original NFT owner/creator
    pub original_nft_mint: Pubkey,    // Source NFT mint address
    pub fractional_token_mint: Pubkey, // Fractional token mint address
    pub total_fractions: u64,         // Total shares available
    pub price_per_fraction: u64,      // Price per individual share
    pub fractions_sold: u64,          // Shares sold to date
    pub is_sale_active: bool,         // Current sale status
}
```

### **KYC Compliance Account**

```rust
pub struct KycAccount {
    pub user: Pubkey,           // User wallet address
    pub is_verified: bool,      // KYC verification status
    pub registered_at: i64,     // Registration timestamp
    pub verified_at: Option<i64>, // Verification completion timestamp
}
```
